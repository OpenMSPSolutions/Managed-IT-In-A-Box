# Managed IT In A Box
*** THIS PROJECT IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE USED AT THIS TIME. ***

Managed IT In A Box is an single pane of glass for managing your MSP or other IT Service Company. At it's heart lies a power PSA to onboard and manage your clients, from there you will be able to install modules to integrate your stack into a single dashboad for management.



## Why an open project?
To quote CyberDrain's Kevin Tegelaar "I'm kind of done waiting for vendors to catch up to what we actually need." While some vendors were very good at listening to the channel, in almost every major PSA implementation you had to shoe-horn in addtional tools to make them work for your needs and client base. The truth is our industry will never be a one size fits all type of Industry, but that is exactly what we are going to be forced to accept if we keep allowing these huge VC/PE funds to gobble up all of our tools.

I like many of you started in an age where almost everything that we pay $1-3 per user/device per month for now was done by our own scripts. Yes they were a pain to maintain but we did not have a collective behind us to maintain them. By building the PSA as an open project we can combine the collective knowledge of the entire industry to build Best Practice solutions accross our entire stack.

Managed IT In A Box is meant to UI ontop of this vision. The module system will allow us to start with creating plug-ins for today's widely used industry tools bringing your entire business operation into a single Best Practices/SOP driven PSA architecture.

Why the ELv2 you ask? Two simple reasons, first. I want to see this project thrive and that means ensuring companys like the major players of today's IT Industry do not get to make private fortunes off of the hard work of the IT Community. Second  - I plan to fund development of the software by providing a hosted version of the software to IT service companies that do not have the resrouces or knowledge to self host.
